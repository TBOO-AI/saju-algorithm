# TBOO - AI-based Asian Fortune Telling üçÄ

TBOO.AI is a consumer-centric decentralized application (DApp) that combines traditional Asian fortune-telling with AI technology to facilitate the transition from Web2 to Web3.

## What is Saju (Four Pillars of Destiny)?

Saju is a destiny interpretation system based on Oriental philosophy, composed of four pillars representing the year, month, day, and time of birth. Each pillar consists of a combination of Heavenly Stems (Â§©Âπ≤) and Earthly Branches (Âú∞ÊîØ), which are used to analyze an individual's innate personality and flow of destiny.
